would like to automate:
  check to ensure that all links on site are valid (google webmaster tools helps with this long-term)

rss/atom
  test using feedly.com (other RSS tools?)
  validator: https://validator.w3.org/feed/
  Filed bug for key validation failure on RSS: https://github.com/jpmonette/feed/issues/41

scripts:
  npm run clean-post - cleans the one latest post, or N most recent
  npm run make-post - creates one new file, updates previous' next key
  npm run generate-json - creates recent.json and all.json files in public
  npm run generate-rss - creates rss.xml and atom.xml in public
  npm run generate-tags - creates files at pages/tags/* based on all tags included in post frontmatter
  npm run update-rankings - gets piwik data, then adds or updates rank frontmatter property

gatsby
  linked fork generates ids for each header, allowing for deep-linking into articles

html
  overall page is structured properly
  CSS loads in develop and production
  Javascript loadss in develop, but only in production of config.noProductionJavascript is not set

wrappers/md
  Scrolling to hash links - be sure to check back/forward, scroll positions, etc. Messy.

generateMetaTags
  Meta tags for articles are well-formed
  Meta tags for front page and other non-articles are well-formed
  Test with structured data validators:
