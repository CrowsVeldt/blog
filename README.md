# blog.scottnonnenberg.com

A [`gatsby`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)-based blog.

## Forking gatsby!

Note that this project relies on my [fork of `gatsby`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/gatsby/tree/anchors). To prevent confusion, I've removed it from the dependency list, though `npm` scripts do refer to it. To make those scripts work, I've used `npm link` in my local `gatsby` fork directory, and `npm link gatsby` in this project.

## Key settings

`config.toml` contains key data you'll want to change first. The location of the blog, author name and details, and so on.

`piwik.js` is excluded from the repository, but is used by `html.js` (to generate piwik tracking tags) and `scripts/update_rankings.js` (to get popularity numbers for posts). These four keys are required:

  - `domain` - where your piwik server is
  - `siteId` - the site number
  - `site` - the site domain
  - `token` - your API access token, used by `update-rankings` npm script

## Develop

```bash
npm run develop
```

This runs `gatsby`'s hot-reloading development server on http://localhost:8000. It will have to be restarted if you rename, add, or remove files because [`webpack`](https://webpack.github.io/)'s watch mode doesn't handle those kinds of filesystem changes.

## Build

Generate files to `public/` folder. Will fail if there are outstanding `git` changes. Pre-gzips all files. Calls a shell script behind the scenes, so you might run into some problems on Windows.

```bash
npm run build-production # or npm run build-staging
npm run build-production -- --force # build even with outstanding git changes
```

## Test

Run `eslint` and the unit tests with `npm test`. All utility code and React components will be tested in Node.js. `npm run unit` will just run the tests, and `unit-watch` and `unit-coverage` are also available for active development. Once you've generated code coverage numbers, `npm run open-coverage` makes it easy to open [`istanbul`](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)'s the HTML report.

You can use `npm run serve` to serve static files from `public/` at http://localhost:8000 for manual and automated tests. A manual test script is available at `tests/manual.txt` - it covers the parts of the user experience without automated tests.

Once you have the static server running you can check for broken links:

```bash
npm run check-local-links
npm run check-external-links
npm run check-deep-links
npm run check-links http://localhost:8000/
```

_Note: Due to the meta tags on each page, you'll get broken links until you've published all pages to production._

## Helper scripts

```bash
npm run make-post -- "The name of your post"
```

Creates a new markdown file from the template at `scripts/util/_postTemplate.md`. Sets the new post's `previous` URL to the last most-recent post's URL, and updates the previous post's markdown file with the newly-generated posts URL. That was annoying to do by hand. :0)

```bash
npm run clean-post
npm run clean-post -- 5
```

By default processes the most recent file. If a number is provided, it will process that many most-recent posts. Removes smart quotes, duplicate links (same text as URL), and all mentions of the blog's `domain` (taken from `config.toml`) to ensure that links are all of the relative form.

```bash
npm run generate-tags
```

Loads all posts from `pages/posts` and extracts all of their tags. Ensures that a file `pages/tags/TAG.js` exists for every tag found. Prints out a count for each.

```bash
npm run update-rankings
```

Goes to my stats system (which uses [Piwik](https://piwik.org/)), grabs the top URLs, massages the data a little bit, then updates the `rank` property of the frontmatter in each markdown file. If you use this, you'll want to periodically change the end date for the query.

```bash
npm run generate-rss
```

Generates `rss.xml` and `atom.xml` into `public/`. Runs as part of every build.

```bash
npm run generate-json
```

Generates `all.json` and `recent.json` into `public/`. Also runs as part of every build. I generate this file for easier syndication into other sites, like https://scottnonnenberg.com.
